This is Soonami app it git data from api as JSON and parse it in Listview using OkHttpClient library

I use in this project:


1 - Using **OkHttpClient** library to fetch data from Api as JSON and parse it.

2 - **Listview** to view list of data.

3 - implement **setOnItemClickListener** on Listview to open url for more details.
