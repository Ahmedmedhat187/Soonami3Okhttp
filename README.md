# Soonami3Okhttp


This Soonami app using OkHttp library to fetch earthquakes data from api and parse it to json to display it in listview

I use in this project:


1 - Using **OkHttpClient** library to fetch data from Api as JSON and parse it.

2 - **Listview** to view list of data.

3 - implement **setOnItemClickListener** on Listview to open url for more details.
